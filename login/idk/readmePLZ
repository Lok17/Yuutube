i changed my main program to classes, however i don't think it is a good idea to do so.
because when you new a class B inside class A, the A doesn't appear, and if you want to go back and use A again, B doesn't appear either.
the program will be like A->B->new A and it keeps on going
i think this is vey dangerous and may cause exception when the chain goes longer and longer and eventually it will take over your RAM
although it will make combining code easier, unexpexted errors may appear, i am not sure if it's worthy
